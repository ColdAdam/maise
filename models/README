a) nn_* models are neural network based potentials, trained with the MAISE code, and named as:

   nn_(system name: series of elements)_(dimensionality of the dataset used for the training)(model version; 0 for the main model)

   e.g.:   nn_CuPdAg_30 is the main NN model for the Cu-Pd-Ag ternary constructed using the 3D (bulk) dataset.
           nn_CuAu_00   is the main NN model for the Cu-Au system trained on the bulk and nanoparticle datasets.



b) gp_* models are Gupta potential parameters, collected from the literature, and named as:

   gp_(system name: series of elements)_(dimensionality of the system that model is prepared for)(model version)

   note:   1- GP models are collected from the literature (cited in the reference entry in the model file)
              and were originally for nanoparticles.
           2- The cut-off range of the models are adjusted to be usable for the bulk systems, hence _3# models are created.
