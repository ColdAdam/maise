00 - RDF Example

Calculates gaussian-smeared bond distance distributions (RDF) of particles in 
a structure and outputs raw and normalized RDF and 
nearest neighbor lists. Optional arguments are:

NMAX: max number of neareast neighbors
RSFT: soft cutoff radius
RHRD: hard cutoff radius
SPRD: amount of gaussian spreading

If optional arguments are not specified, then defaults will be used.

The maise executable must be compiled and copied into this directory before execution.
